DESCRIPTION:

The program executes a game for A and B to find each other on an n*n board using the shortest path.
 - The main function first reads the input file (input.txt)
 - The Board Size, Costs for 4 operations, A's position, B's position. and Blocks are stores in global variables.
 - The A* function is called to find the shortest path using three different kinds of Heuristics. The optimal path of the 3 heuristics is stored in a stack.
 - The output function prints the number of expanded nodes and the optimal solution path to output.txt
